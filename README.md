# ime_seqfilter

A docker image providing the SeqFilter tool

## Prerequisities

In order to run this container you'll need docker installed.

* [Windows](https://docs.docker.com/windows/started)
* [OS X](https://docs.docker.com/mac/started/)
* [Linux](https://docs.docker.com/linux/started/)

## Usage

The docker image provides the [SeqFilter](https://github.com/BioInf-Wuerzburg/SeqFilter) tool. It will run the `SeqFilter` command as entrypoint.
Therefore, running a container is as easy as:

```
docker run --rm greatfireball/ime_seqfilter --version
```

Just provide all required parameters via command line.
Default working directory is `/data`.
Therefore, input data should be mounted using `/data` volume.

Another example using `--min-length 10000` and `--base-composition N` as parameter and the test file from SeqFilter as input:

```
docker run --rm greatfireball/ime_seqfilter --min-length 10000 --base-composition N /opt/SeqFilter/test.fa
```

Running the command to get the information for a local file `localfile` in the current folder:

```
docker run --rm -v $PWD:/data greatfireball/ime_seqfilter --min-length 10000 --base-composition N localfile
```

## Releases

The master branch contains a rolling release.
The develop branch is used for further development.
